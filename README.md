\## Project overview

This is a beginner, legal, and fully-contained cybersecurity learning project. I built an isolated lab using VirtualBox and Metasploitable2, ran DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App), and reproduced a basic SQL Injection vulnerability on DVWA's SQL Injection page. This repository contains lab notes, a finding write-up, and instructions to reproduce the lab locally.



\## Repository contents

\- `lab-setup.md` — Steps to set up the lab (no VM images included).  

\- `findings/VULN-001.md` — Detailed vulnerability finding (SQL Injection).  

\- `media/` — screenshots   

\- `PERMISSIONS.md` — safety and permission statement.



\## Quick usage

1\. Read `lab-setup.md` to reproduce the lab environment.  

2\. View `findings/VULN-001.md` for the vulnerability write-up and evidence references.



\## Safety note

All testing was performed on an isolated local VM. Do not run the payloads on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
